# Task 1 

## Task 1.1

The main business-related problem is that **in Jordan we don’t have various web pages for online food ordering**. So, we have **created a web page that combines different kind of restaurants in one web page** so the online food ordering process is much easier for the user.

User and system requirements:

1-	The home page contains a slideshow for the available restaurants on the website, each food category has its own slideshow.

2-	When the user clicks on the restaurant that he/she wants the website will open the restaurants page. 

3-	In each restaurant page there’s a full menu. 

4-	The user can check the shopping cart he/she filled and can remove/add to cart and can cancel order or place order.


5-	The user can see the bill details with each meal’s price.


## Task 2.1

**The risks we face in the process while creating the project:**

1-	Time management and task dividing: We had a vision for tomorrow but there was a lot of tasks we should do so we gave each one of us a task and by that we finished the project successfully.

2-	Bad team communication: Each one of us wanted to create something the opposite than the other and we had some struggles but at the end we chose the best solution and the solution that we all accepted. 

3-	Learn new things: Not all of us have the full knowledge to create an advanced web page so we helped each other and searched for ideas and answers on other sources like google. 

4-	Website is unstable: The website crashed many times while we were working on it but every time the website get crashed we figure it out and fix it. 

## Task 3.1

•	List of requirements:

1.	The system must have a home page that contains all restaurants in a slide show for each food category.

2.	The system must contain a href to go to the restaurants page to order.

3.	The system must contain a full menu in the restaurants page.

4.	The system must contain all the orders in the shopping cart and the user can cancel the order or place the order.

5.	The system must have a page to display the number of items the user has chosen.

6.	The system must have a page to display all invoice details.

**Database design:**

LocalStorage Function

We have a constructor that takes the name and the price of the meal after that it push it to an array after that it saves it to the LocalStorage and that’s how we save the data.

**Wireframe**

**Home page wireframe**

**Agile:** The Agile computer program improvement demonstrate was basically aiming for making a difference developers construct a extend which can adjust to transforming demands rapidly.

**Scrum** is the sort of Agile system. It could be a system inside which people can address complex adaptive issue whereas efficiency and inventiveness of delivering item is at most elevated conceivable values. Scrum employments Iterative process.

**Features of Scrum are:** 

 Scrum is light-weighted system.

 Scrum emphasizes self-organization.

 Scrum is straightforward to understand.

 Scrum system offer assistance the team to work together.
