## Task 2.1

## IDE

 ### **PyCharms vs. Visual Studio Code**
 
 ## **PyCharms:** 
 PyCharm gives smart code completion, code inspections, on-the-fly mistake highlighting and quick-fixes, beside robotized code refactorings and wealthy navigation capabilities.


 **Cleverly Code Editor**

 PyCharm’s smart code editor gives first-class back for Python, JavaScript, CoffeeScript, TypeScript, CSS, well known layout languages and more. Take advantage of language-aware code completion, error detection, and on-the-fly code fixes!

 **Smart Code Navigation**

 Use smart look to bounce to any lesson, record or image, or even any IDE activity or tool window. It as it were takes one tap to switch to the declaration, super strategy, test, utilizations, execution, and more.

 **Fast and Safe Refactorings**


Refactor your code the intelligent way, with safe Rename and Delete, Extract Method, Introduce Variable, Inline Variable or Method, and other refactorings. Language and framework-specific refactorings help you perform project-wide changes.

## **Visual Studio Code**

Visual Studio Code combines the straightforwardness of a source code editor with powerful developer tooling, like IntelliSense code completion and debugging.

At its heart, Visual Studio Code highlights a lightning quick source code editor, idealize for day-to-day utilize. With back for hundreds of languages, VS Code makes a difference you be immediately beneficial with syntax highlighting, bracket-matching, auto-indentation, box-selection, bits, and more. 

Intuitive console shortcuts, simple customization and community-contributed console easy route mappings let you explore your code with ease. For genuine coding, you'll regularly advantage from tools with more code understanding than fair blocks of text. Visual Studio Code incorporates built-in support for IntelliSense code completion, rich semantic code understanding and navigation, and code refactoring.

And when the coding gets extreme, the extreme get debugging. Debugging is regularly the one include that developers miss most in a leaner coding experience, so VS Code made it happen. Visual Studio Code incorporates an intelligently debugger, so you'll be able step through source code, review factors, view call stacks, and execute commands within the console. 

 VS Code moreover coordinating with build and scripting tools to perform common tasks making everyday workflows quicker. VS Code has support for Git so you'll work with source control without taking off the editor counting seeing pending changes diffs.

## Operating Systems

### Linux vs. Windows

## **Linux**

Linux® is an open source working framework (OS). 

Linux was designed to be comparable to UNIX, but has advanced to run on a wide assortment of hardware from phones to supercomputers. Each Linux-based OS includes the Linux kernel—which manages hardware resources—and a set of computer program packages that make up the rest of the operating system. 

 The OS incorporates a few common core components, just like the GNU tools, among others. These tools donate the client a way to manage the assets given by the bit, introduce extra computer program, design performance and security settings, and more. All of these tools bundled together make up the useful working system. Since Linux is an open source OS, combinations of software can vary between Linux distributions.

 ## **Windows**

 Windows is a desktop operating system created by Microsoft. For the past three decades, Windows has been the foremost well known operating system for individual computers.

 Each form of Windows comes with a graphical user interface that incorporates a desktop with symbols and a task bar that's shown at the bottom of the screen by default. The Windows "File Explorer" permits clients to open different windows, browse folders, and open records and applications. Most Windows versions incorporate a Start menu, which gives fast access to records, settings, and the Windows look feature.

## Version-control platform

### GitHub vs. GitLab

## **GitHub**

GitHub can be alluded to as numerous different things: 

 A publishing tool 

A version control system 
A collaboration tool Ultimately

**GitHub is all of these things combined and more.**

GitHub permits developers to have their files in a ‘Git Repository’ so that other individuals can collaborate on projects with them, whether they are open for public contribution (open source) or closed for particular colleagues to work on a private project. 

The thought isn't different to the way Google Docs lets you host your word preparing and spreadsheet files and opens them up for collaboration, though developers don't work on the same documents together in real time or make changes straightforwardly within the browser.

One of the foremost common misguided judgments almost GitHub is that non-technical experts, such as marketers, perceive the platform as absolutely a tool for developers. Interests, GitHub’s social dynamics and resource-sharing capabilities distant more closely take after that of a social network - and all marketers can appreciate the control and utility of social networks.

### **GitLab**

GitLab could be a store that as it were lets its group of web designers collaborate on codes. 

 GitLab permits its clients to find a store interior an organization whereas utilizing the free plan.

 Here, the issue tracker permits its clients to relate issues with PRs to be closed consequently. 

 GitLab archives are comparable to documentation for a dialect with a look bar, posting all the records required for the installer. 

 GitLab offers 100% built-in integration. They favor their possess integration instruments with ceaseless developments.  Here, a designer has the specialist to choose whether somebody ought to get to a repository.

 ## Task 2.2


 The tool I have chose to develope my application:

 **IDE: Visual Studio Code**  

 I chose VS Code because Microsoft's Visual Studio Code is much faster as compared to PyCharm. It is greatly lightweight as compared to PyCharm. When it comes to modular approach of wiring code, Visual Studio Code may be a victor. Microsoft's IDE includes a wide run of extensions, add-ons, and other libraries. Also, Visual Studio Code bolsters different Python Interpreter. In PyCharm, you'll be able include virtual situations physically and set their interprets as the default. The most problem with these situations is that they are slow. But in the VS Code they are faster. And Very accessible -- it's consistent with all platforms and environments, free to install, and quick to open Strong native support for numerous languages, and exceptionally solid extensibility to supply progressed language features Git integration is top-notch, regularly showing a much better history, diff, and blend interface that's something else available in version control systems.

 **Operating Systems: Windows**
 
  Windows does all the heavy lifting for me. Also the Interface of the windows is more comfortable for me more than linux. Installing apps like VS code in windows is way easier than linux. 
 
 And of course ease of use it's much easier than linux. 
 
 Last thing available softwares There's a huge choice of computer program available for Windows. This is often both due to and the reason for Microsoft's dominance of the world showcase for PC computer operating systems and office computer program. In case you're trying to find an application to suit your business needs, chances are that in case it exists there will be a Windows form of it accessible some place.

**Version-control Platform: GitHub**

GitHub has higher accessibility and is more centered on infrastructure performance, whereas GitLab is more centered on offering a features-based system with a centralized, coordinates stage for web developers.
GitHub has a few of the finest documentation around. And it let me collaborate with othe colleagues on the same project on the same repositry 

Backup Using an online repository ought to never be considered trustworthy, but it gives a decent and straightforward way to have their code and version history available online, in any case of what happens to their local machine. For some people, this is often enough.


 ## Task 3.2

 •	Black box testing we care about the output. 

•	Linux because its an open source and its fast. 


•	Vs code because it helps you be instantly productive with syntax highlighting, bracket-matching, auto-indentation, box-selection, snippets, and more. Intuitive keyboard shortcuts, easy customization and community-contributed keyboard shortcut mappings let you navigate your code with ease.


•	Github open community it enhances the communication between the team members by using the same repo and write code together.
